Here is where the modified grasp evaluator for OpenRAVE is placed. It is a replacement of the grasper plugin written in C++.

Please note that openrave will try to load anything that looks like a plugin in here. So you cannot make backups of a particular plugin and place them here; OpenRAVE will load them instead of your newer version
